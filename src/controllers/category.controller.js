/**
 * Category Controller - Manages product categorization within businesses
 * 
 * This controller handles the creation and management of product categories within
 * a business context. Categories serve as organizational units that group related
 * products together, enabling better inventory organization and management.
 * 
 * Category Hierarchy:
 * Business -> Categories -> Products
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Business-specific category creation and management
 * - Category-based product organization
 * - Owner-based access control (only business owners can manage categories)
 * - Category lifecycle management (create, read, update, delete)
 * - Validation to prevent duplicate categories within the same business
 * 
 * Business Logic Rules:
 * - Users must own a business before creating categories
 * - Category names must be unique within each business
 * - Categories are automatically associated with the user's business
 * - Deleting a category affects all products in that category
 * - Only authenticated business owners can perform category operations
 * 
 * Data Relationships:
 * - Each category belongs to exactly one business
 * - Each category can contain multiple products
 * - Categories are automatically linked to their business owner

   * Create New Category
   * 
   * Creates a new product category within the user's business. Categories help
   * organize products into logical groups for better inventory management and
   * easier product discovery.
   * 
   * Creation Process:
   * 1. Extract authenticated user information from JWT token
   * 2. Validate category name is provided and non-empty
   * 3. Verify user owns a business (categories require business context)
   * 4. Check category name uniqueness within the business
   * 5. Create category record linked to business and user
   * 6. Initialize category with default settings
   * 
   * Validation Rules:
   * - Category name is required and must be non-empty string
   * - User must be authenticated and own a business
   * - Category name must be unique within the business scope
   * - Description is optional but limited in length
